# Webpage Summarizer | Chrome Extension

A simple Chrome extension that summarizes public web pages using OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model and Jina API. The extension extracts the content from the current tab, converts it to markdown using the free Jina Reader API (`r.jina.ai`), and generates a concise summary using OpenAI's language model. The summary prompt can be customized from the extension options. The output is displayed while streaming and the final output in markdown is rendered using the `marked` library.

Jina Reader API has a rate limit of 20 requests per minute which is sufficient in most cases. The summary generated by the extension is cached for 24 hours in the local storage.

## Development

If you've ever developed a Google Chromeâ„¢ extension, you might have wanted to automate the process of reloading your unpacked extension without the need of going through the extensions page.

[Extensions Reloader](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/extensions-reloader/fimgfedafeadlieiabdeeaodndnlbhid) allows you to reload all unpacked extensions. It can be triggered by browsing to `http://reload.extensions`. You can do this automatically by watching the files in `dist` using a tool like [fswatch](https://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/):
```
fswatch -o * | xargs -n1 -I{} open http://reload.extensions
```
